          I am a passionate developer who enjoys working on various projects. In
          my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies, contributing
          to open-source projects, and participating in hackathons. My previous
          work experiences include both frontend and backend development roles,
          where I gained valuable insights into building scalable and
          user-friendly applications.
